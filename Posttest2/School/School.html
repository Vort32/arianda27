                    <h3>Abydos</h3>
                    <p>Abydos High School used to be a great school. 
                    It has almost disappeared due to the influence of desertification...Everything seems 
                    to be on the verge of bankruptcy after spending a lot of money to stop desertification.</p>

                    <h3>Gehenna</h3>
                    <p>Gehenna Academy is one of the largest and oldest schools in Kivotos. Its culture runs along the concept of "Freedom and Chaos". 
                    Because of this, many troublesome clubs or groups (e.g. Problem Solver) exist and use the main building 
                    and club building whenever and however they please. This has forced the other students to study in only select areas of the campus.</p>

                    <h3>Millennium</h3>
                    <p>Millennium Science School, a huge school specializing in science and technology! Although its history is still short, 
                    it is highly regarded for its cutting-edge science and technology that is unrivaled by other schools, 
                    and it has even become an influential school comparable to Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy.</p>

                    <h3>Trinity</h3>
                    <p>Trinity General School, one of the largest schools in Kivotos with a large chapel! 
                    They're on bad terms with Gehenna Academy, probably because there are many graceful and good students who use Bunburyodo as a model.</p>

                    <p>A school with a unique culture and long tradition, different from other schools in Kivotos, is the Shanhaijing High School. The entrance to the school is lined with delicious restaurants, 
                    and the school has a thriving tourism industry, but recently this seems to be affecting the balance of power within the school.</p>

                    <p>One of the schools in Kivotos, which unlike the others is simple more of a "coalition" of clubs of committees with their own respective rules and policies. 
                    Their main industry is tourism and is applied in a variety of activities, with the largest activities dubbed as "Festivals".</p>
